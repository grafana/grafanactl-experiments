## Unreleased

**Breaking changes**

- Fleet Management and Instrumentation now use the `grafana-collector-app` plugin proxy instead of direct Cloud Access Policy authentication. A Cloud Access Policy token with `fleet-management` scopes is no longer sufficient. Use a Grafana stack login and ensure that the plugin is enabled. Older stack tokens can require a new `gcx login` to obtain `grafana-api:write`. Named plugin routes need `grafana-collector-app:read`. Wildcard routes need `grafana-collector-app:admin`, including some read-only commands. The default `gcx cloud login --scope` list no longer includes `fleet-management:read` or `fleet-management:write`.
- Fleet collector resource manifests now include `spec.id`. Collector creation requires this field. Existing numeric-ID manifests continue to work for update and delete. Add `spec.id` before you reuse an older manifest to create a collector.
- `gcx setup status` now adds `fleet-management` as the first item in `products`. Select entries by `.product` instead of their array position. The command returns exit code 1 when the plugin is missing or disabled. It returns exit code 4 when the Instrumentation check fails. In both cases, it emits the status document before it exits.
- `gcx synthetic-monitoring probes reset-token` now returns the new probe token. Its structured output changes from the `gcx.mutation` schema to `gcx.synth.probe_token_reset`. The `name` and `id` fields move out of `target`, and `id` changes from a string to a number. Update scripts to read the top-level `token`, `name`, and `id` fields.
- `gcx synthetic-monitoring probes deploy` now generates a Namespace, Secret, and Deployment. It no longer generates a ServiceAccount. The Secret keys change from `API_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `API_SERVER_URL` to `api-token` and `api-server-address`. Tools that process the generated manifests must accept the new resource and key names. An identity that applies the complete output must have permission to manage Namespace resources.
- `gcx synthetic-monitoring probes deploy --api-server-url` now requires an address in `host:port` format. Values with a URL scheme or without a port now fail validation.

**New Features**

- Added `--fix-plan` to `gcx instrumentation check`, with two explicit modes: `--fix-plan=local` produces a deterministic aggregation of the explanation docs' "How to fix" sections (offline, no billing, works on OSS/Enterprise), and `--fix-plan=assistant` synthesizes a prioritized plan with Grafana Assistant (BILLABLE, requires a Grafana Cloud context — see the Assistant pricing docs). The two modes are disjoint: assistant mode returns a clear error when preconditions aren't met rather than silently falling back to local. `--fix-plan` alone is rejected; users must specify a mode.
- `GCX_KEYCHAIN=off` stops gcx using the OS credential store, leaving credentials in plaintext in the mode-`0600` config file. It is for machines whose credential store is permanently unavailable, such as headless boxes and CI runners. Credentials already in the store are not moved back out: their references are preserved and unreadable until the variable is unset. Replacing one instead writes plaintext and leaves the previous secret in the credential store unreferenced, which gcx warns about. See [Keychain credential storage](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/as-code/observability-as-code/grafana-cli/gcx/keychain/).
- traces: add experimental `gcx traces baseline <trace-id>` to retrieve same-operation candidate traces (root identity, operation success, and topology fingerprint) to feed into `gcx traces diff`, with optional raw TraceQL filters when the unfiltered candidates are not valid comparisons.
- traces: include Tempo `serviceStats` metadata (per-service span and error counts) in structured trace search output.

**Fixes**

- Correct Fleet resource examples, preserve string collector IDs in resource manifests, and include the collector name and ID in successful create output.

## v1.2.0 (2026-08-25)

**Breaking changes**
- A locked OS keychain is now its own fatal failure class (`Keychain locked`). gcx stops credential-consuming commands instead of falling back to a plaintext write, and the error explains how to unlock the keychain for the session (#1142)
- Remove the broken `gcx assistant dashboard` subcommand (#1230)

**New features**
- Add the Database Observability provider: `gcx dbo11y instances list` and `gcx dbo11y instances get <name>` (#1199)

**Fixes**
- Remove the duplicated `--agent-id` default from assistant help text (#1232)

**Other**
- Add keychain setup and troubleshooting reference docs (#1142)
- Teach the `add-datasource` skill the shared raw-SQL contract (#1227)
- Bump `create-github-app-token` to 0.3.1 and tune the CI review process (#1236, #1217)

- Correct the order of dashboards in the output (#1201)

**Performance**
- Build the discovery registry one time (#925)
- Limit the parallel fan-out in resource commands (#925)

## v1.1.0 (2026-08-14)

**Breaking changes**
- `gcx agento11y collections add-conversations` and `gcx agento11y collections remove-conversation` emit `type: gcx.agento11y.collection_membership` instead of `gcx.aio11y.collection_membership`. `schema_version` stays `1`. No fields changed. Scripts that read `type` must accept the new value.

**New features**
- Add `gcx profiles data-range` for Pyroscope ingestion health.
- Add the same `data-range` command under `gcx datasources pyroscope`.
- Add `gcx instrumentation explain` and `list-explanations` for the finding explanations that ship with `otel-checker` (now v0.3.1).

- Add `gcx assistant investigations list-evidence`.
- Show the chat ID next to the investigation ID in `investigations get`.
- Keep full v2 investigation summaries and totals in list output.
- Filter IRM alert groups by escalation chain and by date window.

## v0.4.1 (2026-06-23)

- **Breaking:** `--log-http-payload` has been renamed to `--insecure-log-http-payload`. The old flag name now exits with an error naming the replacement. Payload-dump behavior is unchanged — credentials, cookies, OAuth refresh tokens, and request bodies still appear in the dump when the flag is set. A startup warning is now printed to stderr when the flag is active.
- **Breaking:** `gcx dev serve --address` now defaults to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) instead of `0.0.0.0`. Users who need LAN or remote access should pass `--address 0.0.0.0` explicitly. The WebSocket livereload endpoint now rejects cross-origin requests from hosts other than `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, or the configured listen address.
- **Soft-breaking:** Custom Rego rules loaded via `gcx dev lint --rules` can no longer call `http.send`, any `net.*` builtin, or `opa.runtime`. No flag is provided to re-enable them. Bundled rules are unaffected.
- Added `--jq` for inline JSON transformation and improved agent-mode hints.
- Added OAuth login support for agent and non-interactive workflows.
- Improved config performance with lazy keychain checks and StackID caching.
- Moved stack management under the `gcx cloud stacks` command group.
- Added App O11y service list, get, map, and operation breakdown commands.
- Added Instrumentation Hub `gcx instrumentation check` diagnostics.
- Expanded Assistant investigations with Lodestone v2 capability detection.
- Expanded Knowledge Graph diagnose, meta metrics, and model-rules support.
- Improved IRM incident filtering, paging, and OnCall escalation output.
- Added metrics instant-query timestamps and richer Tempo tag-value output.
- Hardened local debug surfaces and JSON error output for agent workflows.

## v0.4.0 (2026-06-02)

- Added support for continuing accessible non-CLI Assistant conversations by context ID, with a warning when the source is not CLI.
- Added automatic migration of token-shaped config secrets into the OS keychain, with plaintext fallback when the keychain is unavailable.
- **Breaking**: renamed `gcx kg rules` to `gcx kg prom-rules` to align with `model-rules` and `relabel-rules`.
- Added read-only `gcx kg relabel-rules get` for prologue, epilogue, and generated rule groups.
- Fixed `kg diagnose` verdicts so failing checks no longer report a healthy service, and reclassify scoped no-data checks as label-scope warnings when unscoped data exists.
- Shared Grafana datasource query transport and dataframe wire types across ClickHouse, InfluxDB, and Infinity clients.
- Hardened Claude GitHub Actions secret handling by scoping Vault outputs and restricting `@claude` triggers to trusted repository associations.
- Improved agent guidance for dashboard workflows and Tempo trace analysis, including recommending `gcx traces get --llm -o json` for full-trace analysis.
- Removed several small direct dependencies in favor of internal implementations.

## v0.3.0 (2026-05-26)

- Added ClickHouse, CloudWatch, and Infinity datasource providers.
- Added richer IRM OnCall alert groups and SRE triage tooling.
