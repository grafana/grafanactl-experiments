# Environment variables reference

## `DO_NOT_TRACK`

DoNotTrack disables anonymous usage telemetry when set to "1" or
"true" (cross-tool DO_NOT_TRACK convention). Overridden by
GCX_TELEMETRY.

## `GCX_AUTO_APPROVE`

AutoApprove automatically enables the --force flag on delete operations,
enabling non-interactive operation in CI/CD pipelines.

## `GCX_KEYCHAIN`

Keychain overrides trusted credentials.keychain configuration. "off" is
the only value that disables the OS keychain and persists credentials in
the mode-0600 config file. "on" is the default; an unrecognized value
warns and resolves to "on", so a typo cannot silently write plaintext.
With keychain use on, unavailable and locked stores fail closed rather
than dynamically falling back during login, refresh, or ordinary writes.

## `GCX_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`

DisableUpdateNotifier disables the periodic notifier that reminds users
when their installed gcx skills can be updated. Any non-empty value
disables the notifier (NO_COLOR convention).

## `GCX_TELEMETRY`

Telemetry controls anonymous usage telemetry for this invocation:
"enabled", "disabled", or "log" (print the event to stderr and send
nothing). Telemetry is enabled by default. Any other non-empty value
disables telemetry. Takes precedence over the `diagnostics.telemetry`
config field.

## `GCX_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`

Endpoint overrides the URL usage telemetry is sent to.

## `GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_URL`

APIUrl is the base URL for all Grafana Cloud API (GCOM) resource calls
(stacks, regions, access policies, etc.). Every client talking to GCOM uses
it. It is materialized together with OAuthUrl so authentication and later
API calls stay in the same Cloud environment.

## `GRAFANA_CLOUD_OAUTH_URL`

OAuthUrl is the base URL for the OAuth login flow run by `gcx cloud
login`. It is used only during login. Credential-bearing entries are
materialized as a coherent OAuth/API pair: one explicit endpoint fills its
missing peer; with neither set, gcx derives one unique referenced-stack
Cloud environment or falls back to "https://grafana.com". Incompatible
referenced environments are rejected and require separate entries.

## `GRAFANA_CLOUD_TOKEN`

Token is a Grafana Cloud access policy token used to authenticate
against GCOM.

## `GRAFANA_ORG_ID`

OrgID specifies the organization targeted by this config.
Note: required when targeting an on-prem Grafana instance.
See StackID for Grafana Cloud instances.

## `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`

Password to use when using with basic authentication.
Optional.

## `GRAFANA_PROXY_ENDPOINT`

ProxyEndpoint is the assistant backend URL used as a reverse proxy for
OAuth-authenticated requests. Set automatically by `gcx login`.
This may differ from Server when cloud routing directs CLI traffic through
a separate endpoint (e.g. the assistant app backend).

## `GRAFANA_SERVER`

Server is the address of the Grafana server (https://hostname:port/path).
Required.

## `GRAFANA_STACK_ID`

StackID specifies the Grafana Cloud stack targeted by this config.
Note: required when targeting a Grafana Cloud instance.
See OrgID for on-prem Grafana instances.

## `GRAFANA_TLS_CA_FILE`

CAFile is the path to a PEM-encoded CA certificate bundle file.
When set, this CA is used to verify the server's certificate.

## `GRAFANA_TLS_CERT_FILE`

CertFile is the path to a PEM-encoded client certificate file.
This enables mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication with the server.

## `GRAFANA_TLS_KEY_FILE`

KeyFile is the path to a PEM-encoded client certificate key file.

## `GRAFANA_TOKEN`

APIToken is a service account token.
See https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/service-accounts/#add-a-token-to-a-service-account-in-grafana
Note: if defined, the API Token takes precedence over basic auth credentials.
Optional.

## `GRAFANA_USER`

User to authenticate as with basic authentication.
Optional.
